Amalthea,r,Jupiter,203,"181,300",0.498,1892,E. Barnard,"Amalthea is the reddest object in the solar system and it appears to give out more heat than it receives from the sun. This may be because, as it orbits within Jupiter's powerful magnetic field, electric currents are included in the moon's core. Alternatively, the heat could be from tidal stresses."
Ananke,f,Jupiter,20,"21,200,000",631,1951,S. Nicholson,"Ananke is the largest member of the Ananke group, a family of Jovian satellites which have similar orbits and are therefore thought to have a common origin."

Calypso,u,Saturn,24,"294,660",1.888,1980,B. Smith,"Calypso is irregularly shaped by overlapping large craters.

Phoebe,i,Saturn,220,"12,952,000",550.48,1898,W. Pickering,"Phoebe was the first target encountered upon the arrival of the Cassini spacecraft in the Saturn system in 2004, and is thus unusually well-studied for an irregular moon of its size."

Prospero,f,Uranus,30,"16,256,000",5.346,1999,"Kavelaars, Gladman, Holman et al","Its orbital characteristics are similar to those of Sycorax and Setebos, suggesting a common origin. But its gray color differs from the light red color of Sycorax, implying a different origin."
Proteus,i,Neptune,420,"117,600",1.12,1989,Voyager 2,"Proteus is one of the largest of Neptune's known moons, although it is not as big as Triton. The moon has an odd box-like shape and if it had just a little more mass it would be able to transform into a sphere."
Psamathe,u,Neptune,38,"46,738,000","9,136.11",2003,"D. Jewitt, J. Kleyna & S. Sheppard",Psamathe is so distant from Neptune it takes almost 26 Earth years to make a single orbit around the ice giant.

Umbriel,f,Uranus,"1,190","265,970",4.144,1851,W. Lassel,"Umbriel is the darkest of Uranus' largest moons. It reflects only 16 percent of the light that strikes its surface, a feature similar to the highland areas of Earth's Moon. Other Uranian moons are much brighter. The process by which Umbriel's ancient cratered surface was darkened remains a mystery."
